        Do you also ask yourself if it is too late to invest in bitcoin in 2018? Bitcoin has become a thing, and for those who jumped on it early, a very profitable one. After climbing from $900 to $20,000 in 2017, we have seen one of the biggest market corrections these days, sending bitcoin's price below $10,000.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite a sharp price recovery to over $11,500 today, there is still a risk of further price drops. But let's first have a look at some basics.
    </p>
    <h2>What is bitcoin?</h2>
    <p>
        As defined by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com/what-is-bitcoin?locale=en">Coinbase</a>, "Bitcoin is digital money used for secure and instant transfer of value anywhere in the world. It is not controlled or issued by any bank or government - instead it is an open network which is managed by its users."
    </p>
    <p>
        Bitcoin is traded digitally, but where it stands apart is due to the fact it's decentralised, meaning it is not controlled by an institution. Instead, it relies on a peer-to-peer structure, by a community of people that anyone can join. Those are called 'miners' and they use computing power to verify bitcoin transactions. As an incentive, every time they verify a block of transactions, they get bitcoin as well.
    </p>
    <h2>How to get bitcoins?</h2>
    <p>
        It's easy as pie. Create a bitcoin wallet, connect your bank account or credit card and start your first purchase. But let's come back to our question, is it too late to buy bitcoin? This is what many were asking themselves these days, and lots of people seem to have decided that no, it's not too late. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/news/record-numbers-bitcoin-wallet-openings-transactions-ahead-futures/">Several hundred thousand new wallet openings</a> were registered in december 2017. All these new investors are driving prices higher and it's not clear where the ceiling is. Some analysts even expect it to hit $100,000 in 2018 and some are saying that $100,000 could take ten years to hit.

    <h2>The alternative - Ethereum</h2>
    <p>
        Ethereum, unlike bitcoin, has a core group of developers who control the way that the technology develops. Some experts say that this will give it longevity and certainty in terms of the way it grows. And the great thing is that you can use your Coinbase account for buying Ethereum.
    </p>
    <h2>How much should I invest?</h2>
    <p>
        Honestly cryptocurrencies are very risky and prices are still extremely volatile so only put as much as you’re willing to lose. I'd recommend investing no more than 10% of your worth in risky investments such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

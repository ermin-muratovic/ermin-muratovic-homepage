        <p>Hey friends,</p>
        <p>
            I'm Ermin, you probably know me, or at least heard of me or my work.
            I'm an Austrian software engineer originally from Bosnia and Herzegovina who is also very interested in systems engineering
            combining mechanics, electronics and software to create innovative and intelligent devices and machines.
        </p>

            This is my very first post and I am so excited to have you on my site!
            Over the last one and a half years I've been thinking about starting my personal blog
            and today I'm happy to launch my redesigned website with a place where I can write about all the things I ever wanted to tell you about.

    <h2>What will you find here? What is my goal?</h2>
    <p>
        My goal is simple. I imagine creating a resource for engineers and makers, especially those in the starting phase
        where you can find practical tips and tricks, thought pieces on self-employment and entrepreneurship,
        personal experiments and anything else that might be interesting to you in the field of engineering, be it software, mechanics or electronics engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the time I'll write in English, because it is basically the universal language of engineering and most resources with latest information are in English,
        but English is not my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.
        In addition some articles will be translated into german or only available in german, if they are only relevant to Austrians like me.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, this blog is meant to motivate you and inspire you. It's meant to lower the entry barrier for people who like to get into engineering,
        become better at engineering or simply want to create their own business or product.
        I'll be constantly working on new improvements for the blog, little code adjustments and adding new things.

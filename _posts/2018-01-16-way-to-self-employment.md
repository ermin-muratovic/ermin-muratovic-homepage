        Starting your own business without millions of startup-cash? That requires a bulletproof strategy. A good strategy to minimize the risks of starting your own business is to begin working on building your company while you're still employed with a full-time job that pays a regular salary. That's the way I did it, and I'm still working as an employee while having my own business besides.
    </p>
    <h2>How to start a business while you're still employed?</h2>
    <p>
        Some of the most important factors are your relationship with your company. Understand and follow your employment contract. Anything developed on company time and using company property belongs to the company. Some contracts require you to tell your employer, but also if it does not I recommend you taking permission from your boss.

    <p>
        To be on the safe side, get your employers written permission that they agree on your side business. If your business is not competitive with theirs, this won't be a problem. Maybe you can turn them into a collaboration partner, customer or client. You may even be able to get your employer to invest in your startup, but be sure to consult a lawyer to get trusted advice on how to proceed carefully.
    </p>
    <h2>Organising your time is key</h2>
    <p>
        You will have a pretty tight time schedule with two jobs. Organise your time, make lists and divide your tasks into achievable bite-sized bits, and work out what is genuinely important. Maintaining energy levels is really important, and being able to recognise when you are at your peak is a useful skill to develop. My recommendation is to take some time each day for regeneration - even if it's just taking out the trash or gossiping on the phone to a friend for 10 minutes. You will find it easier to stay fresh and more creative when you remember to take time for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        At some point you will have to consider altering your full-time working contract to a part-time one or maybe you get the opportunity for working flexibly, which could include reduced or changed hours, or even working from home. That is actually the reason why I am still employed, because I got the opportunity to work at a startup mostly from home.
    </p>
    <h2>Do not forget about taxes</h2>
    <p>
        While being employed you are used to your tax being collected and paid by your employer. So it's quite common for newly self-employed to overlook putting money aside for their tax bill. It makes no difference if you are already paying tax on your employment income, because tax is always calculated on total income and so you must declare it. I'd recommend that you always put aside at least 30% of your profits for your tax bill to avoid those nasty surprises.
